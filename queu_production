Producer-Consumer Pattern Summary

-----------------------------------

What is it?
-----------
The Producer-Consumer pattern is a concurrency design pattern where:

- Producer(s) generate or detect events/data and push them into a shared queue or buffer.
- Consumer(s) retrieve and process events/data from the queue asynchronously.

The queue decouples producers and consumers, allowing them to operate at different speeds without blocking each other.

Why use it?
-----------
- Separates event detection from event processing.
- Enables asynchronous and concurrent processing.
- Improves responsiveness and performance.
- Prevents blocking between producers and consumers.

Key Components
--------------
1. Producer: Detects or creates events and enqueues them.
2. Queue/Buffer: Thread-safe data structure that stores events temporarily.
3. Consumer: Processes events dequeued from the buffer.

Related Concepts
----------------
- Event Queueing
- Message Passing
- Asynchronous Event Processing
- Thread-safe Queue

Summary
-------
This pattern is ideal for scenarios like file change monitoring where events are detected (producer) and processed later (consumer), ensuring smooth, non-blocking workflows.
